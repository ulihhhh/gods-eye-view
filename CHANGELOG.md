# Changelog

## September 8, 2026

Earthquake refreshes validate the complete feed and construct replacement entities before clearing the previous snapshot. Malformed rows and duplicate rendered IDs retain the last good entities, overlays, count and timestamp and report a malformed response; unknown magnitude is excluded from M2.5+ rendering.

Non-object or array-valued properties reject the response instead of being treated as an unknown magnitude.

Launch payloads with missing records now say PAYLOAD DATA UNAVAILABLE. Missing names use Unnamed payload; absent or invalid mass stays unknown instead of appearing as 0 KG.

This changelog records public product changes. For the authoritative description
of current runtime behavior, see [`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`](docs/CURRENT-STATE.md).

## [Unreleased]

- Add a live AEMET Weather Stations layer (~850 Spanish stations, colored by
  a continuous temperature gradient) behind a new `/api/aemet/stations`
  proxy. Handles AEMET's two-step envelope/datos fetch and its
  ISO-8859-15-encoded response server-side, dedups the feed's trailing hourly
  rows to one current reading per station, and serves stale data on upstream
  failure. Requires a free `AEMET_API_KEY`, now offered in the POWER UP panel
  alongside the other provider keys. Points use a live ground-relative height
  clamp (`RELATIVE_TO_GROUND`, not `CLAMP_TO_GROUND` or a one-time terrain
  snapshot), so they neither sink into sloped terrain up close nor drift to
  inexact positions as the camera moves. Clicking a station shows a floating
  card with temperature (plus its trailing-hour min/max and dew point),
  humidity, wind (speed/direction, gust speed/direction, and turbulence
  std-dev), both station and sea-level pressure, precipitation, and altitude.

- Add an expiry countdown/expired badge to the POWER UP panel for keys with a
  known validity window (currently AEMET's 3-month issue cycle) — shown only
  once a key has actually been saved through the panel, never guessed.

- Add a live AEMET Weather Warnings layer (avisos) behind a new
  `/api/aemet/warnings` proxy: active zone polygons (amarillo/naranja/rojo —
  the baseline "verde" status is never rendered) parsed from AEMET's CAP
  1.2 XML bulletins, which arrive packed in a plain tar archive with no
  separate zone shapefile needed — every alert carries its own polygon
  geometry inline. Clicking a zone lists every currently active phenomenon
  (event, probability, and whether it's already in effect or starts later)
  in a floating card; a zone can show more than one at once (e.g. wind and
  coastal warnings together). Shares the AEMET key already configured for
  the stations layer.

- Separate terrain, traffic, FIRMS and GBFS middleware into focused provider
  modules, preserving local configuration, routes and cache/error behavior.

- Split satellite and launch-feed server providers into focused modules with
  portable request URL builders, preserving routes and cache/error behavior.

- Keep landmark names when geocoding returns only address components, preventing
  the United States Capitol annotation from moving to a Washington hotel.
  Unrelated outlines leave the valid geocoded marker in place.

- Split aircraft and vessel server providers into focused modules for source
  fetching, AIS records/tracks and shared request helpers; preserve existing
  routes, local setup, fallback behavior and rendering.


### Changed
- Separate explicit browser build settings from standalone environment loading
  and local provider middleware. Preserve provider behavior and root named exports.
- Rename standalone browser startup to `src/standalone/` and add a Node-only
  `gods-eye-view/build/vite` export with checked package ownership.


### Development

- Extract application lifecycle and viewer exports. Split standalone startup into
  scene setup, controls, layer registration, tools and loading UI. Startup failure
  and terminal shutdown release acquired resources and cancel delayed work.

- Adopt Prettier tooling contributed by RohanDaCoder (#227), with an explicit
  file scope, pinned formatter and Linux/Windows CI checks. Format the reusable
  infrastructure modules and their consumer tests. Package boundary checks keep
  those exports separate from app startup and local Node services.

### Fixed

- Separate optional Google server credentials for Places and Street View from
  the browser key, contributed by Tom-Neverwinter (#110). Provider Settings,
  Pinokio's app-specific credential handling and setup diagnostics recognize
  both keys. The Street View tool prefers the server key across environment
  and `.env` sources. Existing single-key and keyless setups remain supported.

- Complete the first-run, view-target prewarm, cockpit-plates and floor-hold
  browser harness renderer portability fixes contributed by Tom-Neverwinter.
  macOS retains Metal; other platforms default to SwiftShader. Cockpit renderer
  assertions and evidence labels follow the actual selected mode. Floor-hold
  explicitly selects its measured 2D billboard mode and keeps its mesh and terrain assertions; software runs are not real-GPU evidence.
  First-run QA now checks the existing attribution Escape-close/focus-return
  behavior while preserving the launcher-underneath regression checks.


- Datacenter and dam factories are available through scoped package exports with
  explicit context, overlay and render callbacks. The standalone app uses the
  same implementation and bundled datasets.

- Local GeoJSON layers share concurrent loads, cancel pending fetches on destruction,
  discard late results, and remove their entity-context records on teardown.

- Unchanged local infrastructure overlays no longer sustain idle rendering.
  Ground samples wait for visible terrain to settle and cannot place a marker
  below its loaded surface; roofs and valid below-sea-level heights are retained.
  Already sampled markers also follow higher terrain as close-up tiles refine.

- Datacenter and dam marker stems use bounded, zoom-dependent active sets with
  stable selection during camera motion. Close-up stems scale to the actual
  camera distance; source totals and submarine cables remain unchanged.

- Keyboard focus rings now survive active/selected button styles across the
  interface. Visual Styles, Location cities and points of interest, search,
  Context/mission actions, Cockpit utilities, and sliders retain a distinct
  focus indicator.
- A short Space press activates a focused control only on key release. Holding
  Space for 500 ms blurs that control before push-to-talk starts, and release is
  then consumed so it cannot also activate the old control. The same hold works
  from the map or page background; text-entry controls remain protected.
- The Location disclosure is reachable with Tab and shows keyboard focus;
  its city, point-of-interest, and search controls do too. Escape from inside
  the tray returns focus to its disclosure and discards any unfinished search;
  Escape on the disclosure itself closes the tray and clears that focus.
- Data Layers ON/OFF buttons show a keyboard focus ring independently of
  their enabled and feed-status colors.
- Display buttons, layout selectors, mode buttons, and sliders show a visible
  keyboard focus ring, including the controls used in Cockpit Display. Enabled
  CCTV camera dropdowns also show keyboard focus.
- Context tabs keep a distinct keyboard ring when selected. Their existing
  Left/Right arrow navigation continues to switch Contacts and Space Missions,
  and both choices remain reachable through ordinary Tab navigation.
- Tabbing through the Space Missions roster now drives the same temporary globe
  rotation and mission-marker highlight as pointer hover, without selecting the
  mission. Keyboard and pointer previews no longer cancel each other.
- Radio power controls, Search Nearby Sites, and Clear Selected Layers retain
  keyboard focus while their async work is busy. They expose that busy state to
  assistive technology and ignore repeated activation until the work settles.
- Live Contacts results retain keyboard focus by contact identity when counts,
  distance order, or pages refresh. If a focused contact departs or rotates off
  the visible page, focus moves to the named explanatory note at the end of the
  list and survives later refreshes there, so the next Tab proceeds beyond the
  list instead of restarting at Contacts or silently selecting another contact.
- Cockpit Live Signals retains keyboard focus during live updates and contact
  reordering, allowing Tab to continue to Display and Radio. If the focused
  contact leaves the list, focus moves to the current briefing tab.
- Cockpit-only Display and Radio launchers show complete inset focus rings.
- Escape collapses the nearest expanded panel containing keyboard focus and
  returns focus to that panel's disclosure when closing from its contents.
  Escape on the disclosure itself closes without leaving the collapsed control
  focused. Cockpit Contact and Live Signals panels follow the same nesting rule.
- Cesium's bottom-left Data attribution control and lightbox Close control are
  in the Tab order and support Enter and Space. Close, Escape, and backdrop
  dismissal restore focus and synchronize the disclosure state.

- CCTV testing uses the normal launcher for keyless startup, credential loading,
  localhost binding, and explicit LAN-exposure warnings while retaining its
  smaller source-pack limits.
- CelesTrak, Launch Library, terrain-height, and aircraft-enrichment failures
  return generic error messages. Related diagnostics omit raw exception details
  and upstream error bodies; response statuses and cache fallback remain intact.
  Includes the security fixes contributed by Tom-Neverwinter in PR #171.

### Fixed

- Map Source keyboard opening retries focus until the selected tile is visible.
  Leaving the disclosure, pointer interaction, or closing the tray cancels the
  pending handoff so delayed work cannot pull focus back.

- Scope, Bloom, Sharpen, location search and generated style sliders expose
  explicit accessible names. The first-run checkbox retains its native label.
- FIRMS records a source as successful only after appending its rows, avoiding
  contradictory success/failure status if aggregation throws.
- Radio country filtering and voice country requests now resolve common English
  names and exonyms that `Intl.DisplayNames`' primary label omits, so requests
  like "play radio in Turkey" no longer fail closed (Turkey → Türkiye, plus
  Myanmar/Burma, UAE, Holland, Swaziland, East Timor, Cabo Verde, Vatican).
  Ambiguous names such as a bare "Congo" or "Korea" still fail closed.
- Mapped-site outages show their scheduled retry countdown and distinguish
  known Overpass rate limits, timeouts, and query failures. Search feedback no
  longer claims a refresh succeeded while the layer is unavailable or loading.
- Mapped installations retain valid ways and relations that provide bounds but
  no center. Invalid, inverted, and excessively wide bounds are rejected.
- Clicking a selected installation again or clicking elsewhere clears its
  selection; later refreshes no longer reclaim it after a click-away.
- Visual presets explain their effects on hover. Unavailable map sources name
  missing credentials and Provider Settings, while configured-but-failed
  Google 3D routes explain the failure without asking for another key.

- The Overpass proxy now rotates to the next mirror on any non-2xx upstream
  response, not only on 5xx. `overpass-api.de` and its `lz4` alias answer 406 to
  the proxy's User-Agent while two of the configured mirrors answer 200 to the
  identical request, so the fan-out stopped at the first refusal with healthy
  mirrors untried. The refusal was also cached to memory and disk and served as
  data — boundary-class queries hold a month-long TTL — which affected every
  Overpass-backed feature: road geometry, annotation outlines and place lookup.
- Existing cached refusals are now ignored immediately, including during
  stale-data fallback. Concurrent identical requests share the same last-good
  fallback when all mirrors refuse, without duplicating upstream requests.

- Refresh vulnerable transitive dependencies and update browser/image tooling
  to Puppeteer 25.10.0 and Sharp 0.35.4. Cesium remains on 1.138.0.
  Browser QA awaits the new asynchronous executable-path lookup.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-01 — Installation and live-data fixes

### Changed

- Tightened the README opening around keyless setup, source freshness, modeled
  experiences, and the accessibility of the provider stack.

### Fixed

- Pinokio now recognizes its nested successful-install marker, so a completed
  one-click install exposes Start instead of returning to Install.
- The keyless `dev-fresh.sh` startup summary now names Esri World Imagery with
  keyless terrain and identifies OpenStreetMap as the fallback.
- All three VIIRS sources now reach the Active Fires layer. Merging a source's
  detections used argument spread, which exceeds the engine's argument limit on
  the two largest sources and dropped them entirely — leaving roughly a third of
  global detections while reporting each dropped source twice, once as
  successful with its real count and once as failed.
- `./scripts/dev-fresh.sh` no longer crashes on stock macOS bash 3.2 when no
  provider keys are exported: expanding the empty external-keys provenance
  array under `set -u` was fatal there. Launches with exported keys are
  unchanged.

### Security

- GBFS proxy body-size cap now measures the response in bytes
  (`Buffer.byteLength`) instead of JavaScript string length, so the
  `GBFS_MAX_BODY_BYTES` limit holds for multi-byte payloads and cannot be
  overrun by non-ASCII upstream responses.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-31 — One-click install, keyless boot, Provider Settings

### Added
- **One-click install** via Pinokio. Keyless boot lands on a live Esri World
  Imagery satellite globe with keyless terrain; OSM takes over automatically if
  Esri is unreachable, and the globe continues without terrain if its source is
  unavailable.
- **Provider Settings** (the POWER UP panel): add, replace, or remove API keys
  inside the app. Credential files are made owner-only before any secret is
  written — verified on macOS and Windows — and keys configured outside the
  panel are shown read-only, never rewritten.
- **Keyless capability responses**: the optional HUD summary and place-search
  endpoints return a deliberate "not configured" success instead of errors, and
  never consume rate-limit quota.
- `.gitattributes` normalizes line endings, so Windows clones pass the full
  test suite out of the box (#81 — thanks @ethanstoner).

### Changed
- README rewritten keyless-first around the provider ladder: zero keys → free
  Cesium ion (eligible personal, non-commercial use) → billing-enabled Google
  Maps.
- Browser-built data modules no longer import `node:fs`; a repo-wide boundary
  scan test keeps it that way (#83 — thanks @ethanstoner).
- Aircraft-identity voice answers explicitly cover operator, type, and route,
  and say so plainly when enrichment is unavailable instead of guessing.

### Security
- Provider Settings answers only local, unproxied requests and disables itself
  entirely whenever the server is shared. Public datacenter and dam datasets
  omit contact-oriented fields (see the dataset READMEs).

## Pre-release development history

The dated entries and internal milestone numbers below predate the first
tagged GitHub Release. They are retained as project history and do not
represent previously published GitHub Releases.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- Added honest aircraft identity narration: callsign, operator, registration,
  type, and route come only from selected-contact context, and missing operator,
  route, or type enrichment is named explicitly.
- Added local, publication-compatible copies of the two README PNGs, with source
  records and third-party-license boundaries in `docs/media/README.md`.
- Added regression coverage for aircraft identity narration and optional-key
  loading feedback.

### Changed

- First-run presentation now opens with Detection `DENSE` at 75%, `ELASTIC`
  allocation, Fade 7%, Outside 1%, scope feather 11%, and aircraft 3D models in
  `PROXIMITY`. Stored state and share links still override these baselines.
- The 17 selected README GIFs remain unchanged and are documented separately
  from the two owner-published PNGs.
- Bundled datacenter and dam snapshots now omit contact-oriented fields and
  note values containing email or phone identifiers. Feature geometry, names,
  operator/capacity/river metadata, counts, and ODbL terms are unchanged.
- Public documentation and the L9 release matrix no longer reference non-public
  planning material or repository history.

### Fixed

- A missing optional FIRMS key no longer turns the complete Environmental
  mission into `LOAD FAILED`. The FIRMS row still reports `KEY REQUIRED`, while
  earthquakes continue to load. Real lifecycle and fetch failures retain
  failure priority.
- The mapped-installations layer retries after an unavailable request when it is
  enabled or the camera settles.
- Aircraft trails attach to the rendered aircraft transform and remain near the
  rear center across headings. Parked aircraft do not draw a moving head
  segment.
- Grounded aircraft keep validated floor evidence through temporary terrain
  outages and wait for measured photoreal-surface evidence before a 3D model
  takes over from its billboard.
- Cockpit altitude uses aviation MSL data rather than Cesium render height.

### Security

- Production transitive dependencies resolve to patched DOMPurify and
  protobufjs releases without changing the Cesium version or application APIs.
- Production dependency audit reports no known advisories; remaining audit
  findings are confined to development and QA tooling.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-23

### Added

- Added a first-run mission launcher for Contacts, Space Missions,
  Environmental, and manual exploration.
- Added terrain-validity gating and bounded last-known placement for grounded
  aircraft models.

### Changed

- Environmental consistently presents both earthquakes and NASA FIRMS fires,
  with honest optional-key degradation.
- The tracked aircraft trail acceptance bar is visual: roughly rear-center,
  stable across headings, with minor hull overlap allowed and no conspicuous
  top, bottom, or lateral projection.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-18 to 2026-08-22

### Added

- Added the four-source Map Source tray, share-link v2 state, cockpit/context
  voice parity, MSL altitude readouts, and close-range tracked aircraft models.
- Added the L9 release-candidate matrix, AIS feed watchdog, voice cost controls,
  satellite classes, and the shared world-overlay host.
- Added deterministic first-run, map-source, floor, overlay, tracking, and
  aircraft-model regression harnesses.

### Changed

- Consolidated world labels, cards, tracked readouts, CCTV thumbnails, cable
  labels, mission labels, and detection presentation under shared allocation and
  lifecycle rules.
- Reduced idle rendering through the render governor and explicit scope mask.
- Improved cockpit layout, context restoration, keyless feed honesty, and
  aircraft 2D/3D handoffs.

### Fixed

- Fixed degenerate depth picks, map-source restore states, route-camera motion,
  bright-ground label readability, grounded display flooring, and cross-layer
  tracking cleanup.
- Fixed stale overlay callbacks, parked-idle render leaks, cable-label sweep
  starvation, and several share-link state conflicts.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-02 to 2026-08-16

### Added

- Added Global Context modes, Cockpit briefing surfaces, Radio context,
  satellite mission replay, and real per-class aircraft models with adjacent
  provenance records.
- Added a shared screen-space overlay system with bounded allocation for labels,
  cards, callouts, detection brackets, and selected-object presentation.

### Changed

- Unified right-side product controls and responsive cockpit/map layouts.
- Migrated public-safe neighborhood geometry to DataSF and tightened safe local
  development defaults.
- Improved proxy resilience, annotation outline bounds, CCTV enable pacing,
  contact de-emphasis, and deterministic visual stacking.

## [Unreleased] — July 2026

### Added

- Added live NASA FIRMS fires, optional live TomTom traffic, Caltrans and TfL
  CCTV packs, CCTV viewsheds and direct-manipulation calibration, citywide CCTV
  cards, Natural Earth regions, analyst queries, and voice routing QA.
- Added the end-to-end vertical-datum system for aircraft, vessels, CCTV,
  annotations, trails, and terrain-aware rendering.
- Added aircraft class silhouettes, path-derived display heading, ADSBDB
  enrichment, cached CelesTrak TLE lookup, and next-ISS-pass prediction.

### Fixed

- Fixed elevated-airport aircraft placement, vessel sea-surface placement,
  close-zoom FIRMS anchors, antimeridian region framing, annotation resolution,
  cross-layer tracking ownership, and CCTV projection lifecycle issues.

## [Unreleased] — June 2026

### Added

- Added OpenAI Realtime voice control, scene-aware entity context, viewport image
  grounding, the AI HUD summary, live AIS vessels, infrastructure layers, map
  source switching, free-text navigation, and server-side data proxies.
- Added hybrid map annotations, 3D aircraft, panoptic detection, tracking
  harnesses, and public data attribution.
- Added MIT source licensing, security guidance, contribution guidance, data
  source notices, and third-party asset boundaries.

### Changed

- Removed the experimental AI video-edit style and retained seven deterministic
  visual styles.
- Moved Realtime text-history trimming to the server-side retention policy while
  keeping only the latest viewport image in conversation context.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-02-18

- Added the Bikeshare Pulse layer and panoptic label improvements.
- Improved tracked-item boxes, post-render alignment, and CCTV projection
  quality.
- Removed the experimental shift-drag CCTV calibration interaction.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-02-10

- Added the initial multi-layer 3D globe experience, visual styles, live
  aircraft, satellites, earthquakes, CCTV, traffic, FIRMS, infrastructure, and
  performance controls.
- Added entity inspection, tracking, scenes, keyboard controls, and shareable
  views.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-09

- Initial project version.
